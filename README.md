# **Inception** (2010)

*Inception* is a mind-bending **sci-fi thriller** directed by **Christopher Nolan**. It explores the concept of **shared dreams** and the possibilities of controlling the subconscious mind. The film stars **Leonardo DiCaprio**, **Joseph Gordon-Levitt**, and **Ellen Page** (now Elliot Page), among others.

## Plot Summary

The plot follows **Dom Cobb** (DiCaprio), a skilled "extractor" who enters people's dreams to steal valuable secrets from their subconscious. Cobb is given a chance to have his past crimes forgiven if he can successfully perform an "inception" — planting an idea in someone’s mind rather than extracting one. As the heist progresses, the lines between dream and reality blur.

### Main Themes

- **Dreams vs. Reality**  
  The movie continually questions what is real and what is a dream, especially through the use of a *totem* — an object used to tell the difference between the two.

- **Guilt and Redemption**  
  Cobb’s journey is not just through dreams but also through his own guilt over his wife’s death, which plays a major role in the unfolding of events.
